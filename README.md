# Epsilon

## A tiny library to simplify serving consistent apis from Lambda with OpenAPI

IMPORTANT NOTE!  This library has been archived. 

Or, more correctly, moved, to the https://github.com/bitblit/Ratchet monorepo under 
ratchet-epsilon-common and ratchet-epsilon-deployment.  No further development will be done
in this repository, it is only here for historical purposes.  Upgrade to the ratchet versions
to get new bugfixes and capabilities.  Thanks!
